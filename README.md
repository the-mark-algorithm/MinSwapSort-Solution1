# MinSwapSort-Solution1
I am providing a solution to HackerRank problems. This problem can be found at https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/minimum-swaps-2/
The rules are as follows:
  You are given an unordered array consisting of consecutive integers i.e. [1, 2, 3, ..., n] without any duplicates. 
  You are allowed to swap any two elements. Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.
  
 I will try to improve my solutions and possibly solve it in a different or more efficient way in different branches. 
 A branch will correspond to a specific way of solving hte problem.
 Thank you for taking the time to look at my code! Hope you find the solutions helpful! (:
